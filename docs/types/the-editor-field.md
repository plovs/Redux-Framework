The editor field creates a TinyMCE editor so the user can edit a textures in a wysiwyg way.

The editor is the same one used when creating posts/pages and custom post types. You also have the option to switch between wysiwyg and a plain HTML editor.

To create the field you would declare it the same as the text and text area fields, seen here:

[The Text Field](/docs/types/The-Text-Field.html)

You are given all the same options as displayed in the Text Field type.
